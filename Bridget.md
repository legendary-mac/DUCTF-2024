# Bridget lives

We are given this cross-arched sorta designed bridge!!

By google lensing the bridge i didnt find any australian bridge on the lens. 

So I went to this [Cool Website](https://structurae.net/en/structures/bridges/tied-arch-bridges/list) and checked every australian bridge since the bridge on the image was clearly tied arch bridge.

Only Marivale Bridge looked similar but after some more inspection it really wasn't.

I tracked almost every rivers in Australia and looked for some bridges. I think I am capable of listing every single Australian bridges by now. 

Turns out it was a bridge in Singapore... I assumed that the bridge was in Australia since other OSINT challenges were in Australia and it is the biggest CTF competition in Southern Hemisphere. I am not rainbolt after all. You win a_metre.

Anyways the building was 4 Points building in Singapore. (I repeatedly tried to smash the bridge name into the flag box)
