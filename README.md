# DUCTF-2024
My progress and writeups in DUCTF 2024

It was such a nice competition to participate in the first place. As a rather inexperienced CTFer, I had a lot of fun solving the beginner challenges. Specially loved the OSINT challenges!

I can easily say that I learned and improved a lot from this competitions.

Here is how i solved the beginner and easier challenges.

Our team, The Team Onigiri got 442nd place overall with 1208 points. In Secondary section, 10th. (We two are both 10th students).

I am happy with how I participated and will definitely improve my rank next year!!
