We are given this nice image of city view! 
This time we don't have the location metadata as expected.

I downloaded the image and tried to google lens the window apparant first. 

It seemed that it was impossible.

Next i tried to recover the text behind the leaves.

Screw that place for using weird font!!

It seemed that it was impossible.

I asked myself, what is the most unique thing here? WELL the colorful building in the distance was recognized by Google Lens and it was 700 Bourke street in AUSTRALIA.

I was so happy!!! Until I walked around and explored every single corner of australia to find the exact point of view... 

After some while it was Hotel Indigo Melbourne on Flinders, an IHG Hotel which was a 4 star hotel, but it DEFINITELY didn't have 4 star name as it took me another 30 minutes find which part of the hotel name was to be flagged...

Regardless of the struggles it was a VERY fun challenge!!
