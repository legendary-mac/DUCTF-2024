# Marketing

*We have the best marketing team!*

*Except for that one monke that looks like they slapped something together...*

*Maybe the bot should lock away that monke to stopping posting stuff online. The other animals should be free, just not the monke.*

At first i googled through a lot, used various riddle websites etc but couldnt get anything. With a little help, I understood that by we they were refering to themself. I searched a bit more and found their twitter full of marketing posters

Among those I found MC Fat Monke's premiere to his rap music. Knowing that it was monke to be the "failure" of their team I carefully watched the video to find the flag glimpse for a second in the video. 

I wonder if anybody found the flag before the competition started though
