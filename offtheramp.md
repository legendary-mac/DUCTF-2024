# Off the Ramp

The first and easiest OSINT challenge we are given an image of very nice boat ramp!

This challenge would have been MUCH harder if they didn't include the location tag into it's metadata ^-^'

just use simple tools like exiftool and you can get its longitude and latitude.

Enter it into google maps or earth to find the location! (I had some trouble with formating ;-;)

it was Oliver Hills boat ramp!
